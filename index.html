    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am an ambitious, hardworking and highly organised senior journalist with
      seven years of experience in the sector. I am quick and eager to learn new
      skills and work to a consistently high standard. I can work independently
      and am a key team player, able to listen to and contribute new ideas to
      discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time at Reach PLC, I have qualified as both a journalist and a
      senior journalist. I have seamlessly transitioned from a print-focus to a
      digital-focus publishing workflow and played an active role in projects
      designed to encourage growth in its news aggregrator platform, InYourArea.
